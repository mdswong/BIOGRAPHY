SHORT BIO ABOUT MYSELF

Hi, I'm Marvin Dale Santiago Wong. I'm a type of person that is shy at first, but eventually after we get to know each other
I would already be comfortable with you. If you want to know more about me, let's begin. My passion is playing volleyball. I am
really into sports since 5th grade. Every after classes, I play any sport I want with my classmates and friends. It is where I
gained my confidence and where I get to know myself better. At home, my mother would always say that I am not that talkative
but I let success be my noise. He is a type of guy that doesn't give up until he reaches his ultimate goal which is to
finish his studies and return whatever his parents deserve in life. Oh, wait. Another thing, I love horror stuff. I would
definitely appreciate watching horror movies or series with me. It's one of my stress relievers. Lastly, if you listen to the
songs of LANY, Lauv, Khalid, Bazzi, Joji and Russ, we would share the same vibe and energy.

Thanks for reading my short bio about myself. Nice to meet you! :)
